  headline: "<strong>A Doctor and an Engineer walked into a Brickyard<br></strong>"
  content: 'We are motivated to build meaningful tools utilizing cutting edge AI research
    with a larger interdisciplinary purpose in mind. We are troubled and inspired
    by the 1963 letter by Bernard K. Forscher titled “<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/142/3590/339.1"><span
    style="text-decoration: underline;">Chaos in the </span><em><span style="text-decoration:
    underline;">Brickyard</span></em></a>” that warns the scientific and tech community
    against drawing in a sea of disconnected/incoherent facts and tools i.e. <em>bricks</em>
    without understanding their interconnections.'
